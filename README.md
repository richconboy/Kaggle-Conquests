Scripts for any Kaggle competitions I participate in or other shenanigans

###Index of Files:
 * **Blizzard API** - This was just me practicing learning APIs and trying to do it in a fun way.  I was able to pull down a picture of my old WoW character!
 * **Dota 2 Match History** - Also learning to work with APIs, except this time I used a Python wrapper.  This code was just me messing around and pulling down stats to show how terrible I am.  Please don't base any hiring decisions on my KDA ratio.
 * **Giant Bomb Text Mining** - Classifying games into genres by text mining short descriptions.  
 * **Homesite Kaggle Script** - Sci-Kit Learn practice on a Kaggle competition data set.  Never made a submission.
 * **Prudential Kaggle Script** - Same as above.  Never made a submission.
 * **Santa's Stolen Sleigh Kaggle Script** - Christmas optimization competition.  Didn't put too much time in but this submission scored our team in the top half of the competition at one point.
 * **Walmart Kaggle Script** - Walmart recruiting competition.  Didn't get to finish working on this because of #Eurotrip2015.  My CV scores seemed pretty competitive, but I suspect there's a problem with my submission generation code.
